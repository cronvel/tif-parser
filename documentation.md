# tifParser: Tab Indented Format Parser

This is a simple parser for Tab Indented Format (TIF, the spec of this format is currently in progress).

It transforms a text file into nested objects.

While it is too general to produce anything by itself, it is actually the first stage of more complicated
and specific parsers.
