# tifParser: Tab Indented Format Parser

This is a simple parser for Tab Indented Format (TIF, the spec of this format is currently in progress).

It transforms a text file into nested objects.

While it is too general to produce anything by itself, it is actually the first stage of more complicated
and specific parsers.

Full BDD spec generated by Mocha:


# TOC
   - [Single line](#single-line)
   - [Sample file](#sample-file)
<a name=""></a>
 
<a name="single-line"></a>
# Single line
when empty, should return a root node without child.

```js
expect( tifParser.parse( '' ) ).to.eql( {
	depth: 0,
	children: []
} ) ;
```

with a single word, should return a root node with one child, no comment and the word as content.

```js
expect( tifParser.parse( 'Hello' ) ).to.eql( {
	depth: 0,
	children: [ {
		depth: 1,
		content: 'Hello',
		comment: undefined,
		children: []
	} ]
} ) ;
```

with a many words, should return a root node with one child, no comment and all words as content.

```js
expect( tifParser.parse( 'Hello world! How are you?' ) ).to.eql( {
	depth: 0,
	children: [ {
		depth: 1,
		content: 'Hello world! How are you?',
		comment: undefined,
		children: []
	} ]
} ) ;
```

with a comment, should return a root node with one child, no content and all words as comment.

```js
expect( tifParser.parse( '# This is a comment' ) ).to.eql( {
	depth: 0,
	children: [ {
		depth: 1,
		content: undefined,
		comment: 'This is a comment',
		children: []
	} ]
} ) ;
```

with content and comment, should return a root node with one child, having content and comment.

```js
expect( tifParser.parse( 'Hello world! # This is a comment' ) ).to.eql( {
	depth: 0,
	children: [ {
		depth: 1,
		content: 'Hello world!',
		comment: 'This is a comment',
		children: []
	} ]
} ) ;
```

should trim whitespace in both content and comment.

```js
expect( tifParser.parse( '  \t Hello world! \t   #   \t  This is a comment \t   ' ) ).to.eql( {
	depth: 0,
	children: [ {
		depth: 1,
		content: 'Hello world!',
		comment: 'This is a comment',
		children: []
	} ]
} ) ;
```

should thow error if the line is indented.

```js
try {
	tifParser.parse( '\tHello world!' ) ;
	expect().fail( 'An exception must have been thrown' ) ;
}
catch ( error ) {
	expect( error.message ).to.match( /Indentation error/ ) ;
}
```

<a name="sample-file"></a>
# Sample file
#1 comparison.

```js
var parsed = tifParser.parse( fs.readFileSync( 'sample1.txt' ).toString() ) ;

var expected = {
	depth: 0,
	children: [
		{
			depth: 1,
			content: undefined,
			comment: "Starting comment",
			children: []
		},
		{
			depth: 1,

			comment: undefined,
			children: [

							children: []
						},

						}
					]
				},
				{
					depth: 2,
					content: "medium3",
					comment: "with a comment",
					children: [
						{
							depth: 3,
							content: undefined,
							comment: "Comment #3",
							children: []
						}
					]
				},
				{
					depth: 2,
					content: "medium4 with many words",
					comment: undefined,
					children: []
				},
				{
					depth: 2,
					content: "medium5 with many words",
					comment: "and a comment",
					children: []
				}
			]
		},
		{
			depth: 1,
			content: "Big2",
			comment: undefined,
			children: [
				{
					depth: 2,
					content: "not a \\#comment here",
					comment: undefined,
					children: []
				}
			]
		},
		{
			depth: 1,
			content: undefined,
			comment: "The next node is not a child of this comment",
			children: []
		}
	]
} ;

expect( tree.diff( parsed , expected ) ).to.equal( null ) ;
expect( parsed ).to.eql( expected ) ;
```
